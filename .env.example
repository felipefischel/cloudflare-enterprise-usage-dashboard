# Environment Variables (Optional)
# 
# By default, all credentials are configured via the dashboard UI and stored in KV.
# For enhanced security, you can set the API token as a Wrangler secret:
#
# npx wrangler secret put CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN
#
# If this secret is set, it will override the UI-configured API token.
# 
# NOTE: Account IDs are always configured via the dashboard UI (not via secrets)
# to support multi-account setups.
# 
# NOTE: Do not commit a .env file with real credentials to version control.
